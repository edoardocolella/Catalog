This program was a little assignement for the exam Tecnologie per IoT, from the third year of Bachelor Degree of the Ingegneria informatica course of Politecnico di Torino

The program is really crude and certainly error-prone. Despite this, it belongs to my growth path in the world of development

Thanks to my collegue Andrea, my partner during the course.
